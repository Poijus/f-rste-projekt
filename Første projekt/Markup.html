    <strong> see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
    Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
    And Eternity in an hour.</strong>
    
    A Robin Red breast in a Cage
    Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
    A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons
    Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
    A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
    Predicts the ruin of the State.
    A Horse misus'd upon the Road
    Calls to Heaven for <span class="red"> human blood </span>.
    Each outcry of the hunted Hare
    A fibre from the Brain does tear.
    A Skylark wounded in the wing,
    A Cherubim does cease to sing.
    The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
    Does the Rising Sun affright.
    Every Wolf's & Lion's howl
    Raises from <span class="red" > Hell</span> a Human Soul.
    The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,
    Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
    The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
    And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
    The Bat that flits at close of Eve
    Has left the Brain that won't believe.
    The Owl that calls upon the Night
    Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
    He who shall hurt the little Wren
    Shall never be belov'd by Men.
    He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
    Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
    The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
    Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
    He who torments the Chafer's sprite
    Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
    The Catterpillar on the Leaf
    Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
    Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
    For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
    He who shall train the Horse to War
    Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
    The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,
    Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.
    The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
    Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
    The poison of the Snake & Newt
    Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
    The poison of the Honey Bee
    Is the Artist's Jealousy.
    The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags
    Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
    A truth that's told with bad intent
    Beats all the Lies you can invent.
    It is right it should be so;
    Man was made for Joy & Woe;
    And when this we rightly know
    Thro' the World we safely go.
    Joy & Woe are woven fine,
    A Clothing for the Soul divine;
    Under every grief & pine
    Runs a joy with silken twine.</k>

 <div style="background-color: cornflowerblue;">
    
    <p>Some are Born to sweet Delight.
    Some ar Born to sweet Delight,
    Some are born to Endless Night.
    We are led to Believe a Lie
    When we see not Thro' the Eye
    Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night
    When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.
    <strong> God Appears & God is Light
    To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,
    But does a Human Form Display
    To those who Dwell in Realms of day.</strong></p>
